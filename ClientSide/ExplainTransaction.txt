a. When a new transaction starts (i.e., when a client sends a query with a new token), check if a connection for that token already exists in the activeTransactions. If not, create a new connection, set auto-commit to false, and save the connection against the token in activeTransactions.

b. If the client sends subsequent queries with the same token, retrieve the connection from activeTransactions and use it. Do not commit after every operation since the transaction is still ongoing.

c. Only commit (or rollback) when the client indicates the end of the transaction. Also, if the token is "N/A", you'll know it's a standalone query, so you can commit immediately and close the connection if needed.
